# D-Ad-app-Beta

## Providing services that allow you to receive rewards by utilizing personal data (D-AD: Using Web3 Advertising Protocol without Data Collection)

### Premise conditions of the service:

```
1. No collection - Personal data should not be collected.
2. Rights to assets - Receive reasonable compensation when consenting to the use of personal data.
3. Transparency & fairness - Compensation is provided transparently and fairly through smart contracts.
4. Localization and Decentralization - Personal data ownership should be held by individuals rather than centralized servers.
```

### Project Details:

Existing advertising systems collect personal information to target ads, which leads to many problems such as personal information leaks, as the data is stored in a centralized database.

D-AD services using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) can maintain decentralization by verifying personal information stored on the userâ€™s local device to target ads. This enables the provision of services while preserving user privacy.

We define three components for building Web3 services: prove, own, and apply, which must be separate. YourD belongs to prove and own. We will manage personal data and derivative data using DID and create an auth system that people can use easily without knowing if it is applied to blockchain, using the WebAuthn method.

This service is different from existing wallets. In this service, users can store and utilize various data as well as digital assets. Moreover, through the YourD auth system, people will be able to easily log in to other dapp services.

Lastly, there is the D-ad service, which stands for Decentralized advertisement. This service is a suitable advertising service for the Fourth Industrial Revolution and Web3 world. To summarize this service in the simplest way, it is an advertising service that enables targeted advertising without collecting personal information. This service will be provided in two ways, CtoC and BtoB, and it also has the advantage of allowing individuals to advertise at a low cost.
